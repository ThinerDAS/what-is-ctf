# What is CTF, in simplest codes

"What is CTF?" I have encountered this question many times, asked by ones who are adept at programming yet not familiar with CTF. Such colleagues might lack the knowledge considered common to active CTF players, including common sense about OS mechanics, computer architecture, compiler and binary structure, socket and network, etc.

Here I provide several templates indicating the common patterns of CTF, in hope that it will be useful for everyone interested, to have a decent knowledge of what CTF challenge is like, and how your programming skill can apply here. (For example, this repo will answer the question "I know Euclid's Extended GCD algorithm, and how can I apply it to relevant CTF problems?")

Actually there is a good news and a bad news here. Good news is that great programming skills are much rarer and more precious than plain knowledge of miscellaneous knowledges, such as common anti-debug techniques and pwning cliches. Bad news is that normal programming enthusiasts tend to underestimate the programming skill of a normal 3-year CTF player. To be neutral and fair, your power is measured solely by the highest difficulty challenge that you can ever approach in a CTF. In other words, your score speaks aloud.

Have a good day, folks!
